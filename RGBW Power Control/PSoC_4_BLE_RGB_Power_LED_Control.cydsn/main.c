*                           THEORY OF OPERATION
*******************************************************************************
* This project demonstrates the capability of PSoC 4 BLE to communicate 
* a BLE Central device over custom services and control color and brightness 
* level of RGB Power LED. This allows to control the hue of power LED in a room 
* as per user's choice. The project requires external RGB Power LED/Lamp that is 
* connected to BLE Pioneer kit. 
*******************************************************************************
* Hardware connection required for testing -
* External RGB Power LED Lamp with individual control for Red, Green and Blue
* color values is required for this project.
* Pin assignments are as follows:
* On Board R-G-B LED 	- P2[6], P3[6] and P3[7] (hard-wired on the BLE Pioneer kit)
* External R-G-B LED	- P3[0], P3[1] and P3[2] (Pin 1,3,5 on header J2)
* User Switch			- P2[7] (hard-wired on the BLE Pioneer kit)
* LED On/Off			- P3[4] (Pin 9 on header J2)
